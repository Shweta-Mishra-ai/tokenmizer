## [Unreleased] — security/correctness audit pass

Full senior-level audit covering security, silent failures, dead code,
and benchmark honesty. See `TESTING.md` for what's verified vs. not, and
git log for the full per-commit breakdown (9 commits, each independently
reviewable).

### Security (see `tokenmizer/security/`)
- **Critical:** `auth.py` failed OPEN (auth silently disabled) on any
  settings-read exception. Now fails CLOSED (503).
- Background LLM extraction call was not redacted — a real secret pasted
  into a session could reach a third-party extraction model. Fixed by
  redacting once at ingestion, before any downstream consumer.
- `redact_messages()` crashed/silently skipped on multimodal content
  (None or list `content`). Added AWS/Slack/Stripe/JWT patterns.
- "Prompt injection detection" relabeled honestly as a basic keyword
  filter (it's a 10-pattern denylist, not a security boundary); fixed
  wrong `429` status code to `400`; fixed multimodal-content bypass.
- `config/settings.py`: a YAML parse error silently fell back to
  insecure defaults with zero indication. Now logs loudly.

### Correctness
- `compression/engine.py`: LLMLingua (lossy ML compression) could be
  applied to code blocks, risking semantic corruption. Added
  `CodeBlockGuard` to exclude code from the compressor entirely.
- `CommentStripper`'s `//` regex matched inside string literals (e.g.
  URLs), truncating them. Also found and fixed a *pre-existing* bug:
  trailing `# comment` style was never stripped at all (only
  leading-`#` comments were).
- `hybrid_extractor.py`: `merge()` permanently lowercased file paths and
  labels into its output instead of using normalization only as a dedup
  key — wrong on case-sensitive filesystems. Found via testing the
  benchmark rewrite below.

### Reliability — silent failures made visible
- Checkpoint save/list, graph eviction persist, and state-backend writes
  used to fail silently (caught, logged at low severity, swallowed).
  Now raise typed errors or are tracked via a new
  `AnalyticsEngine.record_silent_failure()` counter, surfaced through
  `/api/stats`.
- `graph_memory/graph.py`: decision-contradiction-check failures and DB
  reinit failures were debug-only. Now logged at warning and tracked via
  `decision_tracking_failures`/`persistence_broken` on `GraphStatsDTO`.

### Performance
- `graph_memory/graph.py`: `_persist()` rewrote the entire node/edge set
  on every call. Added dirty-flag tracking to skip redundant rewrites
  (the underlying O(n)-per-write cost when a write IS needed is
  documented as a tracked follow-up requiring a real schema migration,
  not silently left as solved).

### Benchmark honesty
- `benchmarks/checkpoint_accuracy/runner_v3.py`'s `MockLLMProvider`
  sampled its fake output from the same ground-truth dict used to score
  recall — circular, not a real measurement, despite being presented as
  one (90-100% hybrid recall) in the README. Rewritten to verify
  `merge()`'s logic contract against known-overlap fixtures instead, plus
  a real `--live` path. The unsubstantiated README number was removed,
  not replaced with another guess.

### Cleanup
- Removed dead imports across `benchmarks/`, `tests/`, and `tokenmizer/`
  (each verified individually before deletion).
- Added `scripts/static_audit.py` (unused-import / silent-failure-pattern
  scanner) and `scripts/run_stdlib_tests.py` (zero-dependency regression
  suite) as permanent repo tooling.

## [0.2.3] — 2026-06-22

### Core reliability fixes

**to_context_block() — quality rewrite**
- Superseded decisions no longer shown as `~~old label~~` (wastes tokens, risks LLM confusion)
- Now shows: `Note: N decision(s) changed — see graph history` or compact `Changed: X → Y` transition
- Completed tasks: importance+recency weighted, capped at 6 most recent (not all 50)
- Node deduplication: skip nodes with same 20-char normalized prefix
- Active decisions show rationale inline; invalidated decisions show `[DO NOT USE]` warning

**query_at_time() — temporal correctness**
- Was broken: called `query()` which excludes SUPERSEDED nodes → temporal queries returned same as current
- Fixed: scans ALL nodes, filters by `valid_from <= at_time AND (valid_until==0 OR valid_until > at_time)`
- Verified: PostgreSQL visible at t_middle, correctly hidden after superseded by SQLite

**merge() confidence — no longer silently overwritten**
- Corroboration confidence (0.95/0.80/0.65) now stored per-decision dict

- `_apply_extracted()` passes `confidence=` to `add_node()` directly
- `add_node()` uses caller confidence when explicitly provided, validator default otherwise

**chat_completions() split: 272L → 86L orchestrator**
- `_check_rate_limit()` 10L
- `_apply_compression_layers()` 36L
- `_update_graph()` 102L
- `_call_provider()` 62L

### Refactoring

**heuristic_extract() 194L → two methods**
- `_extract_one_message()` 140L — all 5 passes on a single message
- `heuristic_extract()` 36L — window setup + calls helper per message

**visualization.py extracted (new, 231L)**
- `to_vis_json()` and `to_obsidian_canvas()` moved from graph.py
- graph.py now has 10-line thin wrappers; backward compat preserved

**graph.py: 1835L → 1172L (-36%)**

### Long session performance
- 200-turn session: <5ms/turn (verified)
- Auto-prune at 200 nodes: works on fresh graphs via importance fallback
- `processed_hashes` capped at 500 entries

## [0.2.0] — 2026-06-07

### What's in this release

#### HybridExtractor — 3-pass extraction pipeline
- Pass 1: LLM-powered structured extraction (JSON schema, ~85-90% recall)
- Pass 2: Enhanced heuristic sweep (file paths, decisions, errors, dependencies)
- Pass 3: Confidence-weighted merge — corroborated items reach 0.95 confidence
- Result: ~88-92% recall vs ~45-55% heuristic-only

#### Rate limiting
- Token-bucket rate limiter: 60 req/min per client, burst of 10
- Stale bucket eviction + hard size cap (50k clients) prevents memory growth
- Returns `Retry-After` header on 429

#### Bug fixes
- Compression quality gate: fixed inverted ratio check (was rejecting good compression)
- Session locks: replaced unbounded dict with LRU-bounded (max 1000 sessions)
- CORS: restricted from wildcard to specific methods and headers
- Semantic cache: safe-by-default scoping (session-scoped unless explicitly generic)
- `to_context_block`: replaced O(n²) tiktoken loop with single-count + char estimate
- Rate limiter: added hard size cap to prevent unbounded memory growth

#### Known limitations (planned for v0.3)
- **Streaming not yet supported**: `stream=true` returns HTTP 501. True SSE streaming
  requires rearchitecting the pipeline (compression + cache + graph all need the full
  response). Planned for v0.3.
- Context Router: reserved in config, not yet implemented.
